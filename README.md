# chopwatcher

This program uses the FSEvents API to monitor .wav files dropped into the directory you pass it. It will rename those files appropriately with a numeric prefix. That is to say, if you drop `foo.wav`, it will become `000_foo.wav`; if you then drop `bar.wav`, you'll yield `001_bar.wav`.

I wrote this because TidalCycles likes to refer to samples in a given directory with a numeric identifier, and I was tired of manually figuring out the number to which a given sample corresponded.

To run: `just run DIR`.
